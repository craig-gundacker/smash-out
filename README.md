# smash-out

This application began as an assigned exercise to animate a single JavaFX circle object. It then sprawled from there.  It now most closely resembles the classic arcade game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)">BreakOut</a>.  On the first run, a user can select from preloaded, in-progress games or select a new game.   While playing, the user can quit and save the game state to be opened at a later time.  Earn enough points and the player gets on the top scorer list.
